# Business Problem
Due to intense competition and the increasing variety of services offered by many providers, customer churn is a common challenge for ISPs. The cost of acquiring new customers is higher than that of retaining current ones. Therefore, customer retention becomes a critical priority.

# Objectives
1. What are the habits of customers who churn and those who donâ€™t churn?
2. How can we build effective machine learning models to predict customer churn?

# Data Preprocessing
1. Handling Missing value
2. Handling Abnormal Data
3. Handling Outliers
4. Rename Column

# Conclusion 
1. Customers who churn cancelled the service around the subscription age of 22-24 months (almost 2 years) and experience service failures very often.
2. Customers who churn are mostly those who subscribe to TV services, with an average bill cost of around $21-30.
3. The customer churn model is ready to be created.
