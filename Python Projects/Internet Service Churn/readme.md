# Business Problem
Due to intense competition and the increasing variety of services offered by many providers, customer churn is a common challenge for ISPs. The cost of acquiring new customers is higher than that of retaining current ones. Therefore, customer retention becomes a critical priority.

# Objectives
1. What are the habits of customers who churn and those who don’t churn?
2. How can we build effective machine learning models to predict customer churn?

# Data Preprocessing
1. Handling Missing value
2. Handling Abnormal Data
3. Handling Outliers
4. Rename Column
5. Add New Column

# Conclusion 
1. The majority of customers who churn are those subscribed only to internet services (without additional tv or movie services)
2. Churned customers mostly canceled the service within the first 1-2 years of subscription age
3. Churned customers tend to experience more service failures
4. Churned customers’ average bill tends to be lower, around $25.
5. Most churned customers do not have an active contract, though there are some who do and still decide to leave.
6. Churned customers are more likely to exceed their data limits more than twice, leading to additional charges.
7. The churn prediction model will help identify customers likely to cancel their services.

# Recommendation
1. Offer a 10% discount on the next bill for customers who agree to extend their subscription
2. Offer a promotional package that includes additional TV channels and movie packages for a limited time.
3. Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning to prevent overfitting and other feature engineering
